Randonneuring: the art of riding a bicycle ridiculously far for fun.

More specifically: the sport made up of brevets, which are non-competitive,
self-supported, ultra-distance, against-the-clock cycling events.

From the summer I started riding, brevets were my goal. It was no easy thing,
because the penny ante for a brevet is 200 kilometers (124 miles). This was the
year that it all came together for me: training, bike fits, and a full season
of events.

# 100km
I rode the Sterling Populaire on April 9th with the New England Randonneurs,
finishing in *4:39*. 

What went well: two months of mostly-structured indoor training beforehand.
I was in really good shape for this, and my time reflects that. Though I didn't
ride alone, I kept up with a strong pair.

What went poorly: I showed up to the brevet without the route in my bike
computer. Well, that just meant I had to stick to a group. And I showed up
about ten minutes before go-time, so I was scrambling to get geared up in the
parking lot. That didn't really change.

# 200km
Two weeks later I rode the Wachusett, Oakham, and Purgatory brevet, again with
NER. I finished in *10:23*.

What went well: This was just a beautiful route through central Massachusetts!
I still think about the winding climb through a new development, up to the golf
course. Not much stoppage time, I was quick in and out of controls. My nutrition
was good, I had enough to eat the whole day.

What went poorly: I did not have enough to drink in the first three hours.
Actually, I had nothing to drink, because I left my bottles in the car. The
biggest rookie mistake I made all season, and the reason I decided to write
packing lists. Luckily I was able to get bottles at the first control...wow.

After my 200k I felt super strong. Then I got covid! Or a really bad flu. I'm
still not sure what it was, but I was in bed for a week and didn't train for two
or three.

# 300km
Didn't make it to the NER Ware's The Quabbin 300km, but I did drive out to the
Midcoast Maine 300k on June 11th. I finished in *16:30*.

What went well: Another wonderful course through mostly-quiet roads in Maine.
A lot of good memories riding with a great group for most of the day.
This was the debut of my Otso Warakin Ti and my first time riding in the night.
I really liked night riding and electronic shifting! My gear worked as I
expected it to. Finally, I finished strong in the night after feeling like I
struggled in the afternoon, and chased down a nice round finishing time.

What went poorly: This is where my long-ride-specific problems emerged. Shoulder
and neck soreness, lower back pain, foot numbness from narrow shoes. I didn't
figure out mitigations during the ride, and took too long to develop solutions
afterwards.

# 400km
I went back to NJ to visit my mom and rode the Wildwood 400k with the NJ
Randonneurs on June 25th. I finished in *20:35*.

What went well: I survived a brutally hot day. 90 degrees and humid at the
Jersey Shore? Get off the bike and hit the beach, man. I didn't quit at the
controls despite really wanting to. Really, I was looking at how expensive it 
would be to Uber home from two counties over. But I gutted through it, and again
was stronger in the night. It was really nice riding in the night with someone 
else, it's spooky out there in New Jersey with green tunnels. Oh, and I had like
five Icee's, one at every control point. Sugar and cooling, heck yeah.

What went poorly: After this I think I finally decided to get different shoes. 
In with Lake, out with Sidi. My shoulders and back were really killing me too,
so I got a suspension stem and seatpost. My appetite went away in the heat, and 
I couldn't get to sleep after such a big day. These would haunt me later...

# 600km
Again, back in NJ. I rode the East Windsor 600k and scratched after the first 
day - 250 miles in 18:35.

What went well: Ridiculous pace on the first day. The weather was cooler, 70s 
but also raining. I ate well but didn't stick with any groups and rode solo 
pretty much the whole time.

What went poorly: I couldn't get to sleep after the first day. Didn't bring an 
extra Benadryl and melatonin wasn't cutting it. After getting one pair of bibs 
soaking wet and finishing the day in them, my undercarriage was pretty tender. 
Either bring an extra pair or get fenders (ideally both).

# 1200km
In August I went to Minneapolis to try a grand randonee. This was the motivator 
for all my training in 2022. When I got to the sticking point of hard workouts, 
I told myself "1200". I attempted the Coulee Challenge starting on August 15th 
to the 18th. The first day was 236 miles; I finished in 20:36. The second day 
was 185 miles and I finished in 17:55. They were the hardest rides of my life. 
I did not start days 3 and 4.

What went well: I loved the course and the ride volunteers were incredible. 
I got to see a part of the world that I otherwise would never have visited, and 
I'm eager to come back for another try at the challenge. My gear held up well.

What went poorly: The rider did not hold up well. IT band pain, knee pain from 
walking hills, left hand numbness - these were the physical reasons I stopped. 
Mentally there were a number of difficulties. Certainly I wasn't prepared in 
either way for the steep and long climbs on the course. If I was able to ride 
them all, I'd have done better with time as well. Solo riding took its toll. 
Groups seemed to give their riders strength.

# 2023?
I'm going to finish a brevet series - 200, 300, 400, and 600. Maybe I'll try a 
1000? I'm not going to try to make it to PBP, though. :(
